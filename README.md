## Details for Teaching Team

I took the following challenges for this assignment.
1.) Added a dropdown box to choose how many special characters to add. I had these special characters appended to the end of the word.
2.) Added a dropdown box to choose between different word separators. The three options were "-", "&nbsp;", and "_".
3.) Added a couple dropdown boxes to determine the minimum and maximum length of the words in the passphrase. Within the passprhase, these were chosen randomly.
4.) Added the ability to have different capitalization options using radio buttons.

## Outside Code

Started from the free bootstrap theme, Bootswatch which was developed by Thomas Park and is available under MIT license at the following directory : http://bootswatch.com/slate/
I also used some code that tried to keep the screen constant when hitting the submit button. Previously, the screen would scroll back to the top of the page. The code examples were taken
from the following blog site: http://www.pchelpforyou.co.uk/blog/pchelpforyou_blog.php?article_id=40%27/
